    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Thai Chicken Curry Noodles or Khao Soi is one authentic regional Thai cuisine that often doesn’t get the recognition it deserves in comparison to other popular dishes. Dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries, Khao Soi is a creamy coconut curry noodle based dish originating in Northern Thailand (with many linking its origins specifically to the city of Chiang Mai).</p>
        <p>It’s a dish which combines common Thai ingredients and flavours such as shallots, lemons (or limes), red curry paste or ground chillies in oil with meat into a curry-like soupy sauce, served on egg noodles and topped with crispy fried egg noodles. Traditionally, Khao Soi is served with chicken; however variations of the dish can also be made with beef, pork and even tofu.</p>
