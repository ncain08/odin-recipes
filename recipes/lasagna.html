        <p>Here’s the thing, our weather says winter, but my recipes are screaming summer!! Or at least very late spring. I think the more and more it snows here, the more I “rebel” and want springier recipes that are fit for the nicer, warmer days I wish we were having.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 medium zucchini or yellow summer squash, sliced 1/8" thick</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground Italian chicken sausage or chicken</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
            <li>kosher salt and pepper</li>
            <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 (32 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded provolone chees</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded dry mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup Panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
            <li>fresh basil, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375° F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish./li>
            <li>Thinly slice the zucchini to about 1/8 inch thick. Lay the zucchini flat on a clean kitchen towel and sprinkle with salt.</li> 
            <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken and brown all over, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the bell pepper, oregano, thyme, and a pinch each of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Stir in the marinara sauce, then remove from the heat. </li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta, provolone, and egg</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1/2 cup of sauce in the bottom of the baking dish. Layer over the zucchini, then dollop over 1/2 cup of the ricotta cheese, and top with about 1/2 cup mozzarella. Repeat the layering until all ingredients have been used...don't stress about making it look perfect. Top with mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover, and bake another 30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the breadcrumbs. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil, the breadcrumbs, and oregano over medium heat. Cook, until the breadcrumbs are toasted all over and the oregano is fried, about 4 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna sit 10-15 minutes before serving. Top with breadcrumbs and fresh basil.</li>
        </ol>
